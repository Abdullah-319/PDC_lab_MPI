# Sorting Algorithms Using MPI

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithms Using MPI** repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of various sorting algorithms in a parallelized fashion using the **Message Passing Interface (MPI)**. It provides insights into the core concepts of sorting and how MPI can be leveraged to distribute and parallelize tasks efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### **1. Sorting Algorithms**
This repository includes the following sorting algorithms implemented with MPI:

- **Bubble Sort**  
  A simple comparison-based algorithm, where adjacent elements are swapped repeatedly until the list is sorted.
  
- **Insertion Sort**  
  Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.

- **Merge Sort**  
  A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.

- **Quick Sort**  
  Uses partitioning to divide the array and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

- **Shell Sort**  
  An optimization of insertion sort that uses a gap sequence for better efficiency.

### **2. MPI Commands**
The repository also includes examples and explanations of essential MPI commands used in parallel processing. These commands help distribute tasks, manage communication, and synchronize processes in the MPI environment.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### **Requirements**
- **MPI Library**: Install MPI (e.g., MPICH or OpenMPI) on your system.
- **C Compiler**: A compiler like `gcc` that supports MPI programs.
- **Command-Line Interface**: To execute the MPI commands.

### **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Abdullah-319/PDC_lab_MPI.git](https://github.com/Abdullah-319/PDC_lab_MPI.git)
